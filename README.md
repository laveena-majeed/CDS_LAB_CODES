ALgorithm for linear search

1. Initialise a list .
2. Start from the leftmost element of the list i.e. index 0.
3. one by one compare x with each element of the list.
4. If x matches with an element, return the index and use break statement to come out of the loop.
5. If x doesnâ€™t match with any of the elements, return -1.
6. call the function and check if return value is -1 then element not found
7. if return value>=0 then element found.
8. end.
